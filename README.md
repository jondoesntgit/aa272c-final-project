# aa272c-final-project

By Jonathan Wheeler for AA272C at Stanford on GPS Technology

The best description for this repository can be found under the most recent report under the report/ directory.

GitHub supports viewing Jupyter python notebooks in the browser. If you need help viewing them, contact me. 

Note that in general, the 1D simulation code works well, but many of the other tests suffer from some unknown error in the rotation matrices used to convert from the IMU frame to the global inertial frame. If you are stumbling across this code at some future date and want to reuse it for your own work, do so at your own peril.

I added a few brief descriptions to the top of the Jupyter notebooks that I found most related to the final work described in the report. There are many other analyses that I performed in other Jupyter notebooks hidden away under misc-jupyter-notebooks.
